      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-short-lived-experience-with-operating-system-development&#34;&gt;My (Short Lived) Experience With Operating System Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;preamble&#34;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago (April-September 2024), I decided to try OSDev. I first started working in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp/&#34;&gt;C#&lt;/a&gt; with the library/framework &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmosos.github.io/&#34;&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;, and I actually got pretty far (as in a terminal and a purple screen). Eventually, I realized that C# wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work for several reasons. I could actually make a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_%28operating_system%29/&#34;&gt;full os in C#&lt;/a&gt;, but the toolchain was too complicated and I decided to use C (which has more preexisting tools and support), and got to work on lithium (My most recent attempt). Working on lithium helped me a lot. It forced me to learn C and how CPU&amp;rsquo;s work on a fundemental level. I used this to work on my own CPU design later. During this short-lived phase, I used The &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.osdev.org/&#34;&gt;Operating System Development Wiki&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;</description>
